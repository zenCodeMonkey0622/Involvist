Frame was downloaded as a zip from https://github.com/jedireza/frame/ and uncompressed into the UserManagement directory
of the Involvist Backend module. It was then added to the Involvist Git repo. Afterwards, 'npm install' was run
on the base directory of frame-master in order to install all the node modules Frame is reliant on. The node-modules directory
for Frame was NOT added to Git.
