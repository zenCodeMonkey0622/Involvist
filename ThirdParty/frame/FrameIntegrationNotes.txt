1. Copy the included 'invConfig.js' file into ClientServices/node_modules/frame.
2. Copy the included 'invManifest.js' file into ClientServices/node_modules/frame.
3. Edit ClientServices/node_modules/frame/index.js to use invManifest.js instead of manifest.js
4. Copy the included 'signup.js' and 'users.js' into ClientServices/node_modules/frame/server/api. Be sure to overwrite
    or save the original elsewhere.
5. Copy the include 'user.js' into ClientServices/node_modules/frame/server/models. Be sure to overwrite or save
    the original elsewhere.
6. Copy the included 'mailer.js' into ClientServices/node_modules/frame/server. Be sure to overwrite or save the
    original elsewhere.


Miscellaneous:

I had to allow less secure apps access to the Gmail account otherwise Frame isn't able to login
via SMTP. Not sure how I need to solve this, or if it even needs to be addressed now. Via Google's
message:

"Google will continue to block sign-in attempts from the app you're using because it has known security problems or is out of date.
You can continue to use this app by allowing access to less secure apps, but this may leave your account vulnerable."

Is nodemailer module out of date? Have to figure this out.
